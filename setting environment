///******requirement******///
training in windows os system
       python 3.5or6
pacakges: 
scipy
Pillow
cython
matplotlib
scikit-image
tensorflow>=1.3.0
keras>=2.0.8
opencv-python
h5py
imgaug
IPython[all]

///******some suggestion******///
some problem i met when setting up the environment
1.downloading the Anaconda(support the version >= py3.5)
2.if you download the the version of python=3.7,you have to creat a virtual environment which is the python3.5or6 environment by using command
"conda create --name your_env_name python=3.5or6"
3.then activate your env, starting install the pacakges required

///******why using virtual environment******///
there are always some error ,warining existing when using the origin version 
for example:
some packages are hard to install perfectlylike tensorflow 
i had ever spent a day to install the package after uograde
the conda upgrade the pip, it still not worked.
To start your training quickly ,from my previous experience, i strongly suggesting you creat a env if you are a window's user.
